# Run a background task with Web Job
**NOTE: This is a dotnet framework Console application (NOT dotnetcore)**

## Observations
1. Web job can be configured on any existing Azure App Service (Web App or Web Api)

2. Web job supports **exe, cmd, ps etc**. But not dll's.

3. Any **dotnet Framework console application** can be configured as web job

4. By default, dotnetcore console project output is **dll**. Hence may not be able to configure directly.
