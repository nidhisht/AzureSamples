# Web Api Connecting to Azure Cosmos DB

Cosmos DB is a **multi-model**, **globally distributed** database.

Cosmos DB enables horizontal scaling.

Cosmos DB stores documents in collections. Within collections, documents are split into groups called Logical Partitions. This is done using Partition keys. Cosmos DB reshuffles logical partitions into physical servers using physical partitions.

This sample covers **Core SQL API** in Cosmos DB.
